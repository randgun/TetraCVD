Good\n","hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was stabilized\n","eventually requiring 7 units of packed red blood cells and 1\n","unit of fresh frozen platelets.  Hematocrits were followed q\n","day and remained stable approximately 28.  The patient\n","declined repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy for further\n","evaluation.\n","\n","2.  End stage renal disease:  Patient on hemodialysis.  The\n","patient missed one week of hemodialysis prior to admission.\n","However, at the time of admission he was restarted on his\n","Renagel, Nephrocaps and required significant calcium\n","repletion.  The patient underwent dialysis three times a\n","week. On [**11-2**] his dialysis line was removed secondary\n","to bacteremia.  Please see further discharge summary for\n","further details of the patient's hemodialysis.\n","\n","3.  Bacteremia:  The patient was four out of four bottles\n","showing Methicillin resistant staph aureus.

HIV/AIDS:  The patient was continued on ____________\n","prophylaxis.  The patient is not on HAART due to medication\n","noncompliance.  The patient's CD4 count was 46 on [**10-28**].\n","\n","7.  Hypertension:  The patient had originally been admitted\n","with elevated blood pressures requiring significant\n","intravenous medications.
